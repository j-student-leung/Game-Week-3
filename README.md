# Game-Week-3
This week's objective was to find a way to make the new MonkeyKing avatar fit into the houses, as well as add a new animation.
Lessons learned: Got more experience in tracing code between HTML/JS, learned about JQuery, experience in creating/animating spritesheets, first time writing code in JS.
